mRelief is an open source, user-facing web and SMS application, dedicated to solving social service challenges using technology in the city of Chicago. Our nonprofit status is through fiscal sponsor, Good City. Our platform, which we created through adept visual design and software development, is mobilizing relief for low-income people by providing them a platform to easily determine their eligibility for social service programs. If they qualify, they are directed to their next step. If not, they are referred to a local community resource to pursue alternatives.
