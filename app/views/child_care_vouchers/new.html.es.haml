    %h1 Do I qualify for a Child Care Voucher?
    .subhead
      %p Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) provides low-income, working families with access to quality, affordable child care that allows them to continue working and contributes to the healthy, emotional and social development of the child. Also commonly referred to as a Child Care Voucher, the state of Illinos helps income eligible families pay for their child care services while they work, go to school, pursue training and other work-related activities.
